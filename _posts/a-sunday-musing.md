It’s been a funny sort of week in the village - a week steeped in muttering, veiled glares across the Post Office counter, and quiet huffs behind net curtains. I won’t name names - though goodness knows I’ve got a list as long as my bad leg - but suffice to say several grown adults, some of them Church-leaning and supposedly mature in years and temperament, have been engaging in hostilities more befitting a flock of affronted geese in a bottleneck. And that’s saying something - geese at least have the decency to honk plainly and nip your shins without subterfuge.\
\
The catalyst? A clump of daffodils that apparently 'leaned' across a garden boundary. Yes. Leaned. Not uprooted. Not built a hostile encampment. Just gently inclined in a south-easterly direction, as daffodils are wont to do. But it was enough, it seems, to revive old disputes dating back to the Great Tinsel Incident of 1998 and that unfortunate business with the mislabelled Bakewell.\
\
Now I understand territorial instinct. We all like to know where our geraniums begin and where our neighbour’s wisteria ends. But there’s something profoundly sad about folk who choose to draw up battle plans over begonias rather than offer a trowel and a cup of tea.\
\
I’ve seen hedgerows fortified, gnomes relocated under cover of darkness, and more than one fence painted in what I can only describe as ‘Defiant Beige’. There are whispers about poisonings - of rose bushes, not people - and a strongly worded note recently passed via the vicar’s pigeonhole, folded three times and perfumed with lavender, like a scented missile.\
\
And here's what really rattles my teacup: this sort of mad behaviour is increasingly treated as normal. Just another Tuesday. As if hedge skirmishes and bin-based vendettas were part of the natural order. But it isn't normal. Or at least, it shouldn't be. Somewhere along the way, the theatre of the absurd has been recast as common sense - and worse still, encouraged by certain corners of the local press who thrive on division. The sort who would have us pick sides in a feud we never started, so we end up buying two extra copies of the Argyle Gazette just to see what fresh outrage is afoot in our own cul-de-sac. Rage is terribly good for circulation.\
\
All this tension, all this energy spent guarding boundaries most of us had no strong opinion on until someone else decided they were sacred. I do wonder what we might achieve if the same vigour were applied to improving the bus timetable or stopping Mrs Blatherwick from hoarding all the decent chutneys at the Co-op.\
\
And here’s the crux of it - sometimes, when I see villagers taking sides over these matters, with lines drawn in gravel and loyalties sworn over cream teas, I can’t help but feel an old sadness stir. Not just because of the noise, or the pettiness, or the fact that someone reversed into the church lychgate ‘by accident’ after the planning meeting. But because I know these people. I’ve watched them lend each other sugar, tend each other’s roses, and cry together when Mrs Dapples’ cat went missing and turned up, two weeks later, wedged behind the water butt looking smug and moderately French.\
\
These are good people. Or rather - they can be. Which makes it all the more baffling when they choose division over decency. When they forget that what unites us isn’t just our postcode or our collective hatred of the council’s traffic cones - it’s the fact we’re all just muddling through, trying to make the garden grow, and maybe find a biscuit at the end of it.\
\
Of course, some will say that boundaries must be defended. That order must be maintained. That compromise is weakness, and the leaning daffodils are only the beginning. To which I say: nonsense. We’re not living on a map. We’re living in a village. We’re not generals. We’re gardeners. And if we can’t find a way to live side by side without deploying passive-aggressive signage and suspiciously loud hedge-trimming at 6:23am, then what hope is there for anyone?\
\
I’m not saying we all have to hold hands in the rain and sing songs of unity. But perhaps, next time you feel the rage boil up over a slightly relocated bird feeder, try taking a breath. Ask yourself what the fuss is really about. And then, maybe, go and feed a duck instead. Ducks never judge.\
\
Yours, hoping for quieter hedges and friendlier fences,\
